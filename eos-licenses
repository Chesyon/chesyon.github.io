    <p>First things first: IANAL. I&#39;ve done some research, but <strong>none of this is legal advice.</strong> If I&#39;ve made a mistake, please <em>politely</em> let me know. </p>
    <p>I&#39;m an Explorers of Sky ROMhacker. Most of the libraries used for modifying Explorers of Sky (namely, <a href="https://github.com/SkyTemple/skytemple-files">skytemple-files</a> and <a href="https://github.com/RoadrunnerWMC/ndspy">ndspy</a>) are licensed under <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html">GPLv3</a>. This means that if I use any of their code in my own tools/patches (this <em>includes</em> just using them as an import), I am legally required to release my own tool/patch under GPLv3. I personally find this annoying, but I&#39;ll spare my angry ramblings for a footnote. </p>
    <p>I personally <em>do not care</em> what people do with my code, so long as I receive credit for my work. I do this as a hobby, I don&#39;t care about money. It was very difficult to find clear information on this, but to my knowledge, I <em>am</em> allowed to license my source code separately. </p>
    <p>That being said, for my Explorers of Sky hacking tools/patches, I have chosen to license my source code under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT</a> license. What this means is that while the distribution itself is under GPLv3 (by requirement), you may use my code under MIT, as long as you also follow the licenses of any used libraries. This means that <strong>
        <em>if</em>
      </strong> you were to remove any usage of GPLv3 dependencies from my code (which, admittedly, is easier said than done), you may do whatever you please with it without being bound by GPLv3. </p>
